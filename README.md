- 👋 Hi, I’m @sindoc
- 👀 I’m interested in coding as a form of expression, as well as history, philosophy, Unix, and Web.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning CSS3, evolutionary biology next to my work, which is mainly in the data industry where I have served for a dozen years at least (I used to design RDF schemas when I was 14 :-)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on providing an archetype for data products and help give data models the dignity they deserve.
- 📫 How to reach me? [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sinaheshmati/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sindoc), ...
